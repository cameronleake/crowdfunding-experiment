    <p>In the first phase of this study you will participate in multiple rounds of a simulated crowdfunding session.  In each round you will each be given 150 credits which you can contribute to any of four different projects.  These are fake projects that we have created for the purposes of this study only, and are not connected to any real world projects.  You may contribute all of your credits to one project, spread them out to multiple projects, or choose not to contribute credits to any project.  Each of these projects needs 400 credits to be considered fully funded.  Before each round the researchers will contribute seed credits that will make some projects easier to fund than others.  One project will be given 300 credits, another will get 200 credits, another will get 100 credits, and the last will get no seed money.  As a result of the researchers? seed credits, the projects will only need 100, 200, 300, and 400 credits respectively to be funded.</p>
	<p>If a project is fully funded at the end of a round, each player will receive a payout in terms of credits.  The payout to each player will be based on a preferences list that will be given to each participant.  Each player will have different preferences, and they will change every round.   A player's most preferred project will pay the player 200 credits upon the funding of that project.  The next preferred will pay 150 credits, the next 100 credits, and the least preferred 50 credits.  In addition to these payouts, any credits that you choose not to contribute will be yours to keep and will go into your credit bank.  Any credits that you contribute to projects will not be added to your credit bank.  This credit bank will not be available to use for donations in the subsequent rounds, but all of the credits in your credit bank at the end of the experiment will be converted into cash at the end of the experiment.  The conversion rate will be $1 for every 450 credits.  At the end of all 24 rounds we expect the average payout to be $15 in addition to the $5 you receive for participating.</p>
	<p>Throughout these crowdfunding simulations you may NOT communicate with one another in any way.   After everyone has read the instructions a new page will open with information about your project preferences, the seed money that we have allocated to each project, and the 150 credits available.  You will have the opportunity to open a summary of this instruction page in a pop-up window.  You will have 1 minute in each round to allocate your credits to each project as you see fit.  Your contributions will not register until you hit "submit."  Once you submit your contributions you will be taken to a summary page where you will wait for the round to finish.   Upon the completion of the round you will see the funding status of each project, and the number of credits you earned that round.  Once you are done reviewing the round summary, click the ?ready? button to indicate that you are ready to start the next round.  From here a new round will open and you will have a new 150 credits, new credits, and new projects with different amounts of seed money.
	If you have any questions now or at any point in the study, please raise your hand.  If you need to use the restroom, please wait until you have submitted your donations for the current round.  After these simulations you will be asked two questions about the simulation, and then you will be directed to a separate survey.</p>
